# HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists

**This project was developed for the Machine Learning course. Study only!**

A company that operates in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire scientists from
data among people who were approved in some courses given by
company. Many people signed up for the training. The company wants to know
of these candidates actually want to work for the company after training or
looking for a new job as it helps to reduce cost and time as well as
quality of training or course planning and categorization of candidates.
Information related to demographics, education and experience is at hand
from the registration and enrollment of candidates.
This dataset was designed to understand the factors that drive a
person to leave current job also for HR research. For the model(s) that
use current credentials, demographics and experience data, you will predict the
probability that a candidate will look for a new job or work for the company.

Machine Learning algorithms used:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks
- Decision Tree
